# TSP
In this Repo simulated annealing is used to solve the traveling salesman problem, and visualize the results. 

Starts by using a 2-opt greedy algorithm to build an initial solution.

A simple implementation that provides decent results.

An example of the resulting route on a TSP with 50 nodes.

The fitness (objective value) through iterations.
